## Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
Kaggle's Identify and classify toxic online comments competition


### Had to classify the comments in one or more of the mentioned labels:
   
   'toxic', 'severe_toxic', 'obscene', 'threat', 'insult', 'identity_hate'

used Countvectorizer and logistic regression for classifying the same.
